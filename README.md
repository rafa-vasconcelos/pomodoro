Pomodoro Clock

</center>

## Overview

This a pomodoro clock, based on the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It is used to improve productivity: you set the alarm for a predetermined period of time (usually 25 minutes) in which you'll work without any interruptions. Then you take a break, which usually lasts 5 minutes. By eliminating distractions and resting every 25 or so minutes, this technique will improve your productivity significantly.

## Technologies Used

This project was mainly written with React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Sass was also used.

## Future improvements

This is the final version of the app, functionality-wise. Small design improvements may be added in the future. Improvements in code readability and refactoring of the code may also be implemented.
